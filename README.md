# Grid connected inverters, Filters and Control

The purpose of this repository is to study the injection of current into the grid by distributed generation systems, e.g., photovoltaic. 
The repository covers the AC analysis of the filters, full schematics, and simulations of the grid-connected inverters, both with and without Pulse-Width-Modulation (PWM). 
It is designed to assist beginners in developing a fundamental understanding of power electronics and control theory applications.
Each topic is separated into a different paste, which includes a brief theoretical explanation in a .md file and simulations, primarily in PSIM files.
